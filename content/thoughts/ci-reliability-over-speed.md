title: "CI Reliability > CI Speed (Most Teams Get This Wrong)"
date: "2025-12-21"
summary: "Speed matters, but reliability is what builds trust. Here’s how I prioritize pipeline signal."
---

A fast pipeline that fails randomly is slower than a stable pipeline that teams trust.

I optimize in this order:
1) Reliability (repeatability, stability)
2) Signal quality (real failures vs noise)
3) Execution time (parallelism, smarter test selection)
